## About the Course
The Hacking with SwiftUI course is an excellent resource for learning SwiftUI, Apple's declarative UI framework for building apps across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Each project focuses on specific SwiftUI techniques and concepts, ranging from the basics to more advanced features

## Projects
<b>1. Project 1: WeSplit</b> <br />
&emsp;We learn the basics of SwiftUI by creating an check-splitting app.

<b>2. Project 2: Guess the Flag</b> <br />
&emsp;Here we build a guessing the flag game using stacks, images and alerts.

<b>3. Project 3: Views and Modifiers</b> <br />
&emsp;This is a technique project where we are looking to understand deeper views and view modifiers.

<b>4. Project 4: BetterRest</b> <br />
&emsp;In this project we get to know the basics of Create ML by creating a bedtime calculator.

<b>5. Project 5: Word Scramble</b> <br />
&emsp;Studying the lists better by building a word rearranging game.

<b>6. Project 6: Animation</b> <br />
&emsp;This is another technical project, that introduces us to SwiftUI animation.

<b>7. Project 7: iExpense</b> <br />
&emsp;In this project we build an expense tracker app. We focus mainly on lists, SwiftUI state modifiers and working with multiple views (using sheets).

<b>8. Project 8: Moonshot</b> <br />
&emsp;With this project we create an app that decodes a JSON file and show its contents to the screen. We work here with Codable protocol and JSONEncoder.

<b>9. Project 9: Navigation</b> <br />
&emsp;This one is another technical projects, that introduces us to programmatical navigation.

<b>10. Project 10: Cupcake Corner</b> <br />
&emsp;In this project we create an app for ordering cupcakes. We learn how to work with JSON data from Internet by encoding our order and sending it to the database and then receiving and decoding it.

<b>11. Project 11: Bookworm</b> <br />
&emsp;This project is about the basics of SwiftData. We create here a book review app. We create a Model of a Book and save it to a container.

## Skills Developed
- Mastery of SwiftUI basics, including views, modifiers, and layout techniques.
- Building custom UI components and understanding how to compose views.
- Leveraging data bindings, state management, and the MVVM pattern.
- Integrating animations, gestures, and custom transitions.
- Exploring Swift Data and networking for dynamic app features

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maciejwiacek/HackingWithSwiftUI.git
```
2. Open any project folder in XCode
3. Run the project in the simulator or on a physical device.
